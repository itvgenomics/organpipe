######### PROJECT INFO #########
################################

# Specify the sample name to be used. If you want to process all samples in the reads_path, use "all".
# The reads filenames should include delimiters like _R1/_R2 or _pair1/_pair2 to distinguish paired-end reads.
# Ensure that only the sequencing read files (in fastq.gz format) are present in reads_path.
sample:

# Provide the directory path where the sequencing read files (_R1/_R2 or _pair1/_pair2) are located.
reads_path:

# Specify the type of organelle genome you are assembling: "mito" for mitochondrial or "chloro" for chloroplast.
organelle:

# Define the genetic code to be used for mitochondrial genome annotation (e.g., 1 for Standard Code).
genetic_code:

# If a reference genome is available, specify its path as a fasta file. Leave blank if no reference is available.

########## INPUT INFO ##########
################################

# Indicate the type of sequencing data: "Short" for Illumina short reads or "Long" for PacBio/ONT reads.
sequencing_type:

# Specify the expected genome size range in kilobases (e.g., "15000-18000" for mitochondria).

####### QUALITY CONTROL ########
################################

# Choose whether to run the Fastp software for adapter trimming and quality control on Illumina short reads.
# Options: "Yes" to perform trimming, "No" to skip this step.
run_trimming:

# Provide the path to a text file listing adapter sequences to be removed by Fastp. You can leave this blank if Fastp can identify your adapters automatically.
adapters:

# Set the minimum read length to retain after trimming. Reads shorter than this length will be discarded.
minlength:

# Set the minimum base quality score threshold for trimming low-quality bases from reads.
minquality:

########## SEED INFO ###########
################################

# Specify the path to a seed file to initialize assembly. Supported formats: "fasta" or "genbank".
# For long-read sequencing, leave seed_format and feature blank.
seed_format:
seed_file:

# If a GenBank file is provided as the seed file, specify the feature type to use for assembly: "CDS", "rRNA", or "tRNA".
feature:

# If no seed file is provided, indicate whether to search NCBI for reference sequences.
# Options: "Yes" to search NCBI, "No" to skip NCBI search. Ensure seed_format is blank if "Yes" is selected.
search_ncbi:

# List the specific genes (e.g., "COI,16S,ATP6") to search for on NCBI if NCBI search is enabled.
search_genes:

# Specify the taxon name to use as a query when searching NCBI (e.g., "Amphisbaena").
search_term:

# Set the maximum number of reference sequences to download per gene during the NCBI search.
max_references:

######## ILLUMINA STEP #########
################################

# Specify the list of k-mer sizes to be used in genome assembly (e.g., 19,23,28,33,39).
kmers:

# Set the maximum amount of memory (in GB) that can be used during assembly.
max_memory:

# Provide the read length (in base pairs) and average insert size (in base pairs) of the sequencing data.

######## Pipeorg Steps #########
################################

# Indicate whether to run the annotation pipeline for the assembled genome. Options: "Yes" or "No".
annotation: "Yes"

# Specify whether to run nhmmer for identifying non-coding RNA (ncRNA) and intergenic regions. Options: "Yes" or "No".
run_nhmmer: "No"

# Provide the path to the HMM database file to be used with nhmmer.
# We are currently working on a better database for improved accuracy.
# A parsing step will be implemented to enhance this process.
